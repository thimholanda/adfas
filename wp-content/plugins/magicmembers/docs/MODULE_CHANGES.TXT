Changes in Modules:
-------------------

Authorize.net:

	Modified process_notify() in order for listening to Silent Post for ARB SUbscriptions.

	The user will need to set the notify url as the Silent Post Url in Authorize.net Merchant Panel.
	
	The Silent Post will contain x_subscription_id if it is an ARB post and function _process_response() will consider
	 
	this as the case : 'arb_silent_post'. 
	
	Added transaction id as x_invoice_id while creating an ARB subscription and later on x_invoice_id will be captured in Silent Post 
	
	to distinguish the transaction.
	
Added the field: payment_email to Transaction data

	All modules have been updated to include payment_email and keep updated when there is an email goes out for a successful subscription payment.
	payment_email field count will be used to prevent sending duplicate Payment Confirmation email.
	The parent class functions: is_payment_email_sent() and record_payment_email_sent() can be used in modules for checking and updating the email sent count.   	

Worldpay Custom Thank you page changes:

	As Worldpay doesn't support custom Thank you page url redirection, the customer will need to override the default thank you page from Merchant panel.
	So the payment form has been edited to include a fews custom variables:
	MC_success: mgm thank you page url
	MC_error: mgm mgm error page url
	MC_redirectin : redirecttion in seconds
	MC_sitename: sitename
	
	The customer will need to replace the resultY.html and resultC.html template files on Merchant panel with the contents given in Worldpay Gateway Transaction Success Page Contents: and Worldpay Gateway Transaction Failed Page Contents:
	in module settings respectively.

	This will show the default Merchant thank you page following a transaction and if not the meta redirection happened, the user will need to click on the mgm thank you page link to return to the site.
	
Epoch DataPlus Changes:
	
	MGM follows MySQL DB update method for Dataplus.
	
	While enabling the module, the below tables will be created:
	
	1) EpochTransStats: This table is for storing transaction details.
	2) MemberCancelStats: This table is for storing subscription cancellation details.
	(If the tables don't get created, re-enable the module )
	
	As per Dataplus, all the transaction details will be logged into the above tables every 15 minutes.
	
	Create a DB user with select, insert privileges on the EpochTransStats and MemberCancelStats tables allowing epoch.com ( anywhere from epoch.com ) server to insert into both the tables.
	Contact epoch.com and enable Dataplus and provide them  with the IP of the database server(host) and the database name(Wordpress DB name) , DB username and the DB password.
	Also open your firewall to allow epoch.com classes (https://epoch.com/ip_list.php) to connect to the IP/port of your database server that epoch.com will be writing to.
	
	Cron:
	A cron : mgm_quarterhourly_schedule will be running every 15 minutes to check the tables and update user memberships.
