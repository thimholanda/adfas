		This cron finds the members whose membership gets expired on the day. The memberships with a past expiry date also will get processed.
		In order to consider the payments scheduled to be processed on the expiry date, the memberships with a recurring payment will be processed
		the next day of actual expiry date and non-recurring memberships will be processed exactly on the expiry date.
		
		The cron will mark the subscriptions with a billing cycle = 0 OR billing cycle  > 1 with an elapsed expiry date as Inactive
		
		One-time subscriptions will be marked as Expired incase expiry date is reached.
