<p class="bs-padding-1-1">Life&#x2019;s challenges force us to harden up. Relationships, work, children, family and finances all combine to put us under a lot of pressure and the way we are expected to deal with these is to develop resilience and to some extent indifference. <strong><a href="http://demo.betterstudio.com/publisher">We are required to be tough</a></strong>.</p>
<p class="bs-padding-1-1">To teach our kids to be tough and with each blow life delivers to knock us down, we need to get up, dust ourselves off and pick up where we left off. The more times we start again, the colder and more jaded we become.</p>

<h3 class="bs-padding-1-1">What you truly desire. Imagine what you could</h3>
<p class="bs-padding-1-1">Some people believe that showing tough love is an important way to ensure that their children are able to take care of themselves in the future.

<p class="bs-padding-1-1">Without injuring others or placing your own life in danger, it&#x2019;s healthy to let go sometimes. You don&#x2019;t have to be irresponsible to release responsibility and embrace freedom for a change. When life is becoming too burdensome and the weight of obligation and duty seems suffocating, do something that allows you to release yourself from what can feel like a prison.</p>

<h3>Soft is the new hard</h3>
When you think that a situation requires you to be tough, to stiffen your upper lip and puff out your chest in the face of something difficult or even traumatic, consider if you have another option. Maybe for a change it&#x2019;s time to wallow in the tragedy of your experience and really feel what it is to be human. Striving for mental toughness may close you off to a world of emotional development and progress that you may otherwise live through if you let yourself open up for a change.

<ul class="bs-shortcode-list list-style-star">
 	<li>Get a set of flashcards for memorizing vocabulary or grammar.</li>
 	<li>Master the hard pinch (it should be quite hard) to activate your body&#x2019;s threat response.</li>
 	<li>Review a category of flash cards (such as adjectives or group of words). Don&#x2019;t pinch yourself at this stage.</li>
 	<li>Review the same category, now adding the pinch for each vocabulary word. Spend some time studying the card before moving to the next one.</li>

Softening your perspective towards yourself and others; allowing yourself to experience tenderness and nurturing instead may seem counterproductive, but in the long run, may reap more abundant rewards.

<strong><em>Tough is just bravado</em></strong>. Softening up is a new normal you should try.

You may feel sadness more intensely, or anger. Disappointment, fear, grief. The flip side is you may discover joy like you&#x2019;ve never allowed yourself to feel before. You may laugh harder, feel more inspired, encounter wonder and awe at things you previously took for granted.
