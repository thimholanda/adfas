	Magic Member Roles are actually Membership Types added on Members -> Subscription Options, each membership type when added will create a role,we will add Capabilities 
	in code and create section where to apply as when needed.We will not create roles separately on Roles page/tab or edit.
	
	We have Membership type to Wordpress Role compatibity setup in Subscription Options package setting, this is per pacakge setup, on Roles & capability 
	page/tab we will to it at base level, i.e. when capabilities loaded from wordpress default, by selecting it will be auto applied.
